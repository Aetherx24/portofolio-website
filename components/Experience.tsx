                As a member of the UMB Indonesian Student Association, I played a pivotal role in managing and staffing cultural event booths, engaging over 50 students to promote Indonesian culture and significantly increasing club participation and event sign-ups. Notably, I staffed a fundraising booth to increase awareness and support for the 2018 Palu earthquake relief efforts, successfully collecting donations for aid workers in the affected areas.

                Additionally, I coordinated logistics for more than 10 events, ensuring timely starts and reducing setup delays, which improved organizer efficiency and enhanced the attendee experience. I also performed as a singer and guitarist at cultural programs, delivering rehearsed performances to over 30 attendees that contributed to the events' cultural authenticity and received positive feedback.
